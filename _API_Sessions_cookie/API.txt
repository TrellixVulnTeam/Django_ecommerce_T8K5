*) Api-> Application programing interface

app      programs        communicate each other


*) Why API?
As I have read in one blog when you send data directly to the server
it will become heavy and server might crash with heavy data
but with API data will go smothly

*) Multiple sources can communicate with one central server
Ex: you have built one rest api on one side
on the other side you have website with react and flutter with
mobile app, but you have one central api that all frontend can
get data from

This time api is like central service 

*) In normal website like whenyou visit wikipedia, it's going to
render the html css all these going to make up the web page

now in this case response you get from the server, is text
html, javascript

*) So api will return only the data you want to render, that 
data is typically returned json response, it's kind of like 
dictionaries which has keys and values

*) API will only return you the data:
send and receive


*) When you pass dictionaries that time:
def test_view(request):
    data = {
        'name':'john',
        'age':23
    }
    return JsonResponse(data)

*) But when you pass lists
def test_view(request):
    data = {
        'name':'john',
        'age':23
    }
    return JsonResponse(data, safe=False)

*) Link this to url
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
When you press on this you are on root url

{"name": "john", "age": 23}
Called as json payload
